### Link
https://jcw780.github.io/wows_ballistics_old/
## Code Information
### Languages
- HTML, CSS, JS
### Backend Source
- Wasm backend: https://github.com/jcw780/ShellCPP
## Functionality
### Calculate shell performance at impact and in flight
- Belt/Deck penetration - Belt/Deck Impact Angle - Impact Velocity - Flight Time
- Includes all shell types (AP, HE, SAP)
### Calculate Critical Angles
- Maximum angle for penetration - Minimum angle for fusing - Lateral ricochet angles
### Calculate AP performance post penetration
- Shell detonation distance after penetration - Checking whether the armor is thick enough to arm the shell
## Development Status
- Currently still recently released so expect changes 
- Calculations may be refined if contradicting data is provided
### Possible Future Features
- Raw data
